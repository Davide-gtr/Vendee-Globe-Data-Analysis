# Vendee-Globe-Data-Analysis

### Data Analysis project part of the Advanced Master in AI at Télécom Paris (2021-2022)

The objective of this project is to manipulate data from the Vendée Globe 2020-2021. <br>
Initially, the objective will be to retrieve the information from the site by downloading the different skippers' rankings, taking care to clean the dataset and store it in a DataFrame. <br>

Afterwards, I will get the data from each boat and compare it with the skippers' ranking. <br>
Regarding the data analysis:
- Linear regression with VMG and rank
- Display of the course of two participants
- Visualization of the distance covered by each boat
- Histogram of foil types
- Pie chart of the materials used for the keel <br>
To have similar files, I took the liberty to exclude files from January 27th 2021 at 5pm.
